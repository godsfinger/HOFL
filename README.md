# HOFL
Helpful Overlay For Linux

# What is it?
HOFL is a project to integrate a Holographic helpful AGI onto linux, to help boost productivity. It is written within linux, specifically Arch Linux, and can be installed using a .sh script.

It was made for the simple reason I find arch linux boring, compared to windows... also hopefully to boost the market share of linux.

# How to install on Arch Linux
- Step one: Download the files.
- Step two: Make the shell script executable

`chmod +x install_hofl.sh
`
- Step three: Run the script:
`sudo ./install_hofl.sh
`

# To-do:
- Make the window Holographic / Transluscent with the text still readable using Qt.
- Integrate SIVA (Super-Intelligent Voice Assistant) into HOFL.
