# HOFL
Helpful Overlay For Linux

# What is it?
HOFL is a project to integrate a Holographic helpful AGI onto linux, to help boost productivity. It is written within linux, specifically Arch Linux, and can be installed using a .sh script.

It was made for the simple reason I find arch linux boring, compared to windows... also hopefully to boost the market share of linux.
